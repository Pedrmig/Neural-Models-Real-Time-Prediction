# Neural Models for Real-Time Prediction

This repository contains an application that performs real-time object detection using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The application utilizes a webcam to analyze the video stream, identifies objects in real-time, and annotates them with bounding boxes along with the object's name and prediction accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to perform real-time analysis on webcam input.
- **Bounding Box Annotations**: Identified objects are marked with rectangles, and their names along with the prediction accuracy are displayed.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for real-time performance with efficient processing of video frames.

## Model and Libraries

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: The YOLO model is trained on a comprehensive image dataset to accurately detect and classify objects.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for handling video input from the webcam and displaying the output with annotations.
